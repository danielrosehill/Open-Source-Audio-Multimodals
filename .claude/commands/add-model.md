Daniel would like to add a new model into the models folder.

Daniel will provide a hugging face link and/or additional URLs, like the vendor website.

The objective is as follows:

The models folder contains anindex of models that meet the scope of the repository: they are audio multimodal Models which allow users to provide audio data accompanied by text prompts and to derive inference (outputs) that "understands" both elements. 

Daniel is primarily interested in these models because of the significant advantages that he sees them as having over traditional STT and ASR. The repository contains context.
